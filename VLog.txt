당직때 한거

V 0.01
added basic falling algorithm of tetromino object.

what I am thinking to do next:
  if the block falled completely, the coords of block will set to the array (board) so that we can calculate the next block.
V 0.02
added lots of functions, but there are a bug where the rows are not getting removed properly even though i thinbk i did everything right.

added:
    block hit detection
    rotating blocks
    left, right movement
    tried to make removing row func, but faced a bug
V 0.90
finally game is playable. fixed a bug i mentioned previously


fixed bug
    added GameOver detection 
      supposed to be done way long time ago
    added level
      speed increase
      blink green when level up
      blink grey when block removed
    added hold feature
      needs some update. currently show holding item by showing their color
    what need to be done (todo)
      update HIGHSCORE FEATURE!! <-- important one
    adding to localStorage will overlap score with snake game. so what i am thinking is update both snake and tetris bystoring one variable (dictionary)
      in the localStorage as like highValuesSnakes, highValuesTetris and assign those values as key: highscore, value: nnn something like that
        this won't be hard, but will take some time

V 0.95
  added highscore feature
    i have tried to save a dictoionary into localStorage variable but it failed. i think it does not allows to save dictionary cause the file size is too big 
  fixed bug
    when i turn the block when the block is in the very right corner, and the block gets longer in x axis, the block will goes through screen
        i fixed by adjusting x and y coords (y for hitting bottom) once it hit the border or block
  what needs to be done:
      add a display that shows the currently holding block
      made display already but not the function yet.

V 1.00
  finally added the display that shows holding block and the next block. lowkey final version. version after this will be UI update or bug fix
